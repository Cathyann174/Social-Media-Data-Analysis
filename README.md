In this project I stepped into the shoes of an entry level data analyst at a social media agency working with different categories of social media posts. 
My task was to extract tweets that contained information in the different categies: food, travel, fashion, fitness, music, culture, family and health then explore and analyze; to gain insights 
into the performance of the social media posts.  Through exploratory analysis I uncovered the performace of the different categories of posts
such as how often posts were made, how many likes posts were getting, which categories to imcrease the number of posts, and which categories to decrease the number of posts.
Ultimately, this project aimed to provide actionable insights that can help the marketing  agency deliver tweets on time, within budget and gain fast results.

The boxplot reveals that Health category generates the most likes.

Unfortunately, it does not have the most published contents it is fourth on the list.



Recommendation

Increase the number of published contents for the Health and Fitness categories.

Publish less articles for categories that receive small numbers of likes:Travel, Food, Family, Fashion.

Conduct a survey from a sample of the online users to learn about the categories they like and ways to improve the categories that received a small number of likes.

More analyzing is recommended to be performed on the data. Models can be built to better understand the relationship between
the different categories and likes.
